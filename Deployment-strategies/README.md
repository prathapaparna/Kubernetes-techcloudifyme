**Recreae**: shutdown existing pods and deploy new pods with updated version, we face downtime here
- An example Spec: section in the manifest file could look like this:

**Rolling update:** Start new pods with the new version and Gradually scale down the old pods as the new ones become ready.

- To achieve this, **Readiness probes** are used:
- Once the readiness probe detects the new version of the application is available, the old version of the application is removed. If there is a problem, the rollout can be stopped and rolled back to the previous version, avoiding downtime across the entire cluster.


**Blue-Green deployment:** Deploy the new version to the blue environment.Test and verify the blue environment.Switch traffic from green to blue by updating the service.

**canary-deployment:** Deploy a few instances of the new version alongside the old version.Gradually increase traffic to the new version while monitoring.Once validated, switch all traffic to the new version.
